# personal to do list:

* [ ] finish enabling **edit/update** for posts
* [ ] add users! the whole API resource (model, controller, and components)
  * [ ] restrictions for editing/deleting only your own posts
  * [ ] style post "cards" so it shows who posted it and when
* [ ] See note in index.js about making a separate Navbar component and moving the routes out of App and into the index component
* [ ] Styling: the lack of it is distracting.
