# To do list

* [ ] log in seems to... always work?
* [ ] form validations
* [ ] finish enabling **edit/update** for posts
* [ ] restrictions for editing/deleting only your own posts (the post.user_id must match the currentUser.userid)
* [ ] display more useful error messages for login/signup


Completed:

* [X] ~~*more info in post cards so it shows who posted it and when*~~
* [X] ~~*See note in index.js about making a separate Navbar component and moving the routes out of App and into the index component*~~
* [X] ~~*Styling: do more.*~~


## Other thoughts...

* [ ] OAuth (maybe twitter?)
* [ ] Maybe [OpenID](https://openid.net/connect/), because OAuth is [annoying](https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/).
