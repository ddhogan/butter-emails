# Requirements

> from https://github.com/learn-co-students/react-redux-assessment-v-000/blob/master/README.md
- [X] ~~*The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible*~~
- [X] ~~*Use the `create-react-app` generator to start your project.*~~
  - [X] ~~*Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)*~~
- [X] ~~*Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application*~~
- [ ] **2 container components** (currently: 1)
- [ ] **5 stateless components** (currently 4: Post, Posts, About, and App)
- [X] ~~*Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change*~~
- [X] ~~*The Application must make use of `react-router` and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3/docs); docs for v4 can be found [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start))*~~
  - [X] ~~*There should be 3 routes*~~
- [X] ~~*Use this blog to hook up a React-Redux frontend to your rails API backend: [Setup Rails API with React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/)*~~
- [X] ~~*Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server*~~
  - [X] ~~*Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using `fetch()` within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.*~~
- [X] ~~*Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation*~~
- [X] ~~*Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!*~~

[Once your app is complete, fill out this checklist.](https://goo.gl/forms/ULtKsxuzWomvXuTk2)
